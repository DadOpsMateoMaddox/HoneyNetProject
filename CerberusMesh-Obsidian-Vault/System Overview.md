# System Overview

## 🎯 What is CerberusMesh?

CerberusMesh is my AI-powered honeypot orchestration platform that combines deception technology with autonomous threat response. I built it to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber attacks in real-time while gathering high-quality threat intelligence.

The platform leverages GPT-4 for threat analysis and attacker engagement, machine learning for anomaly detection, and autonomous agents for defensive response. What sets my implementation apart is the integration of AI personas that keep attackers engaged longer, providing more comprehensive intelligence about their methods and tools.

## 🎪 The "Fuck Around and Find Out" Philosophy

1. **Invite Attackers In**: Make systems look vulnerable and attractive
2. **Study Everything**: Record all techniques, tools, and behaviors
3. **Learn and Adapt**: Use AI to understand and predict attack patterns
4. **Fight Back**: Deploy autonomous countermeasures and attribution
5. **Share Intelligence**: Feed data to enterprise security systems

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
Attack Event → Honeypot → AI Personas → ML Analysis → MITRE Mapping → 
Cerberus Agent → Response Actions → Enterprise Alerts → Threat Intelligence
```
